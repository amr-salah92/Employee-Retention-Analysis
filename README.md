## Executive Summary

Our analysis highlights salary dissatisfaction, limited promotion opportunities, high workloads, and declining job satisfaction as key contributors to attrition, particularly in the Sales and Technical departments.

### Key Findings:

- **Salary Disparities**: A significant portion of employees who left were on low or medium salaries, despite receiving high performance evaluations.
- **Promotion Deficiency**: Only 2.13% of employees were promoted in the last five years, leading to stagnation.
- **High Performer Attrition**: 53% of employees who left had above-average performance evaluations.
- **Workplace Safety**: While 14.46% of employees experienced work-related accidents, only 169 of the employees who left had experienced a work accident (5% of total left employees). This indicates a need for improved safety protocols to reduce the total number of accidents, but it's not a primary driver of attrition.

Addressing these challenges through strategic initiatives can improve retention, enhance workforce stability, and optimize operational costs.
